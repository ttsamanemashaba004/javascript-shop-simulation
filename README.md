# Javascript Shop Simulation

Assignment Brief: JavaScript Shop Simulation

Objective:
Create a JavaScript program that simulates a small shop. The program will have an array of products and a corresponding array of prices. 

## Note:
1. I created HTML and linked my js script to it so that I can run it on chrome console.
2. I noticed that I need to comment out my function declarations at the end of my js script before run the HTML so that I can inspect what is on the console then uncomment them. Thats if I am using chrome console to test the code.
